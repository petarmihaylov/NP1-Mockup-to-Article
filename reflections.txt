You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* What new skills have you learned?

I didn't really learn anything new on this project. I had come back from a
(longer than expected) break and I just wanted to review some things.
I noticed that this new project was added, so I thought I would start with it.

* What has been easy?

It was easy to get back into the swing of things. I was surprised how much I
remembered from before the break!

* What has been difficult?
It has been difficult to get myself to go back through the training again.
Because I had already put in the time, it felt a little boring, though that is
mostly because of my personality. I don't like repeating myself and I don't
quite like having to repeat a course. Unfortunately my brain "said" that I had
to do that since it refused to just recall it all!
